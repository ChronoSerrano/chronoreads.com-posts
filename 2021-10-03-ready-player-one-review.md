Since I DNF'd [The Graveyard Book]({% post_url 2021-09-29-the-graveyard-book-review %}), I decided to pick up
[Ready Player One](https://amzn.to/3Fdr9IE) instead.

What happens when people and corporations compete for control of everyone's virtual life and riches
beyond the dreams of most?

I was inspired to read this book because the movie was fun.  I'm happy I picked it up since I found it hard
to put down. Even though the film gave me a general sense of what would happen in the book, the differences
were stark enough to surprise me consistently.

The path to the big pivotal point in the story involved a fair amount of deus ex machina. Still, once I
immersed myself and suspended my disbelief, I found these plot points gratifying.

I don't know if everyone will enjoy the easter eggs as much as I did, but they contribute much more to the
story's atmosphere than its plot.

__4/5 stars__ It's a love letter to geek culture, so it might not be for everyone, but it works for me.
