[It Begins with Please And Doesn't End with Thank You](https://amzn.to/3lnl8kF) — Edwin P. Baldry

Edwin P. Baldry lays out a unique format on the common topic of etiquette and behavior.  While the book's focus is primarily on sales roles, many sections intersect with all walks of life.  A key example is the importance of following up and giving proper thanks.  The format stands out, as each chapter includes a parable discussing the concept and one or more sections on implementing the idea.

Additionally, where relevant, there are discussions on how COVID has affected etiquette protocols.  For example, we have options for replacing handshakes in a world where social distancing is a requirement.

Any time there is an opportunity to associate an idea with another chapter, the author takes it.  This pattern allows the reader to go backward or forward in the book to build their connections.
