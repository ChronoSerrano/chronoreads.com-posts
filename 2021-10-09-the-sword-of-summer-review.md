[The Sword of Summer](https://amzn.to/2ZrSqGL) kicks off slowly, but it makes up for it with the vivid descriptions
of Boston that allow me to picture many of the locations they mention.  The comparison of the Longfellow Bridge
to characters from _Doctor Who_ is so accurate that I'll never be able to unsee it.

When the book leaves Boston, it continues to evoke deeply atmospheric imagery of the new locations. Since this is
the first book in a trilogy, I appreciate having well-developed characters at the beginning of the series.
The story moves much more quickly after establishing character growth and reaching the climactic scenes.

Rick Riordan builds the "hero discovers his past" trope without evoking the similar trope required to start
the Camp Half-Blood Chronicles, which is a relief.  If Percy Jackson and Magnus Chase shared similar
backgrounds, I would subconsciously be comparing them throughout the story.

There is a character with Middle Eastern heritage whose background is complex but handled with care.
When discussing a sensitive part of the culture, the topic was brought up and dealt with organically.
