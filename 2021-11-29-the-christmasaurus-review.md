[The Christmasaurus](https://amzn.to/3mQQcKc)

The Christmasaurus is a charming story that reads quickly, about a boy having a hard time in life and the unexpected appearance of a dinosaur that turns his night and life around.  The introduction of the antagonist caught me by surprise and was off-putting initially; however, as the antagonist's backstory developed and connected to the other elements of the story, I was intrigued and wanted more.

The conclusion was satisfying, and I look forward to reading the next book.
