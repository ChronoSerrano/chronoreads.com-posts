[Hammers on Bone](https://amzn.to/3nPt9Pu)

Is "paranormal noir" a genre? That's where this book would fit in perfectly.

This is a novel with a great payoff, but getting there makes the book feel like it's at least twice as long as it is.  The narration is heavy on the noir-style PI dialect, but the narrator acknowledges the odd choice.  Aside from looking up words here and there, the word choice creates clear mental images of what the characters are seeing.

That said, it's a bit hard to tell what is happening until the story is over and the epilogue is either confusing or a cliff-hanger. Unfortunately, I won't be able to decide until I read the sequel novella.
