I wrapped up reading the Camp Half-Blood Chronicles today, so I started to put together my next To Be Read
list just in time for October. Since TheStoryGraph allows for a queue of five books, I put together the following.

1. [The Graveyard Book](https://amzn.to/3obhEn5) by Neil Gaiman
1. [The Sword of Summer](https://amzn.to/2ZrSqGL) by Rick Riordan
