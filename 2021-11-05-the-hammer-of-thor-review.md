[The Hammer of Thor](https://amzn.to/39Ip9JP)

The book starts strong with a scene that reminded me of a noir-style interview between a detective and a witness, then shifting into a spy chase.  This genre-shifting mixed with Norse mythology gives the story a  unique flair you'd likely not find anywhere else.

The last part of the book is a fast-paced, fun read sliding into a cliff-hanger that makes me want to read the next book even more, but getting there had a few slow scenes.  Several chapters introduced a side quest that would have been enjoyable if they hadn't slowed the story's pacing significantly from the sections before and after.

The way Magnus and his friends interact on a nearly family level while leaving room for further growth in their relationship is a beautifully balanced tightrope walk.  They perform a similar act when interacting with gods, balancing required reverence and disbelief at their immaturity.  Their attitudes are analogous to when someone reaches a point in their life when they see deeper into their authority figures than they had been able to previously.

One character, in particular, extends the bounds of Rick Riordan's diversity of characters by being gender-fluid.  This character is especially intriguing because the fluidity is not always controlled, and the pronouns/presentation shift continually through the book.  In the story's context, the character makes sense, and the shifting identity is justified organically.
