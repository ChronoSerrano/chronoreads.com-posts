A book about a boy raised in a graveyard and learning about the world from old-timey ghosts.  What's not to like?

Well... I wanted to like this book, but it couldn't hold my attention.  I read about 1/3 of the book, but I
couldn't connect to the characters and didn't feel the plot was going in a cohesive direction. It's my first time
reading a book by Neil Gaiman, so it's possible his style isn't for me; however, there were enough intriguing threads
in what I read that I'm open to trying out his other works.

The author does a great job of paying off foreshadowing in a satisfying way and immediately reminded me of the setup,
even if the payoff itself didn't resonate with me.

Overall, I'd give this **2/5 stars**.  It wasn't for me, but I wouldn't be surprised to see positive reviews either.
